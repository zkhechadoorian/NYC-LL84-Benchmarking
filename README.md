## 📈 Step-by-Step Guide

# Part 1: Data Preparation and Exploration

**Run jupyter notebook for the Part 1 `notebooks/machine_learning_part1.ipynb`**

## 1. Data Cleaning and Formatting

* Loaded and inspected the dataset, identified missing values, and irrelevant data.
* Removed features that contained a large proportion of missing values (>50%).
* Dealt with categorical variables and formatted them appropriately for analysis.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Explored the distribution and relationships between variables using visualizations.
* Identified and analyzed outliers and their potential impact on modeling.

## 3. Feature Engineering and Selection

* Created new features from existing data to improve model performance (e.g., logarithmic transformations of skewed data).
* Evaluated and reduced features by analyzing correlations and multicollinearity.
* Selected relevant features based on their potential influence on the Energy Star Score.

## 4. Establishing a Baseline

* Set a baseline prediction using a simple naive method (predicting the median Energy Star Score).
* Defined evaluation metrics (Mean Absolute Error - MAE) to measure model accuracy clearly and consistently.

# Part 2: Model Building and Comparison
**Run jupyter notebook for the Part 2 `notebooks/machine_learning_part2.ipynb`**

In the second notebook, you built and evaluated multiple machine learning models:
## 1. Preparing Data for Modeling

* Handled missing data through median imputation to ensure no data gaps.
* Applied feature scaling (Min-Max scaling) to normalize data for effective model training.

## 2. Model Evaluation

* Evaluated multiple machine learning models:

  * Linear Regression
  * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  * Random Forest
  * Gradient Boosting
  * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

* Each model's performance was compared using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Gradient Boosting emerged as the best-performing model.

# Part 3: Model Optimization and Validation
**Run jupyter notebook for the Part 3 `notebooks/machine_learning_part3.ipynb`**


In the final notebook, you focused on optimizing and validating the best-performing model from Part 2 (Gradient Boosting):

## 1. Hyperparameter Tuning

* Conducted hyperparameter optimization using Random Search with Cross-Validation, identifying the optimal settings for:

  * Loss function
  * Number of estimators (trees)
  * Tree depth
  * Minimum samples for splits and leaves
  * Feature selection strategy

## 2. Performance Optimization

* Evaluated the influence of the number of estimators (trees) on model performance to find the best balance between accuracy and model complexity.

## 3. Final Model Evaluation

* Tested the optimized model on an unseen test set to realistically estimate its predictive capability.
* Compared final model performance against a simpler baseline and default model configurations, demonstrating a substantial improvement.




### Step 4 ML Pipeline
```bash
 python3 auto_ml/tpot_exported_pipeline.py
```

This Python script is designed to accurately predict **Energy Star Scores** for buildings by utilizing a robust and optimized **Machine Learning Pipeline**. Its main objective is to demonstrate advanced methods for enhancing predictive accuracy, reliability, and consistency through careful model selection and tuning.

**Machine Learning Pipeline**

The pipeline employs a **stacked modeling technique**, combining multiple models to leverage their individual strengths.

- **Feature Selection Model**: Uses `LassoLarsCV` to simplify and identify the most predictive variables.
- **Regression Model**: Applies `Gradient Boosting Regressor`, known for handling complex, non-linear relationships effectively.

This structured pipeline ensures improved model accuracy and reduces the risk of overfitting.

**Model Training and Predictions**

- The optimized pipeline is trained on the prepared training dataset, enabling it to learn underlying patterns from historical building energy data.
- After training, it generates predictions on an unseen **test dataset** to simulate real-world application.

These predictions help assess how well the model generalizes to new data, which is critical for validating its effectiveness and reliability.
