The score is however self-reported and thus the anomaly at 100 could indicate that some property owners are over-estimating their star score rating. The peak at 0 is perhaps due to default values set when a self-reported value doesn't exist. Though the score is self-reported, it relies on a number of factors which are rigorously measured and, thus, more reliable as a metric of energy efficiency. One of these factors is the Site EUI (energy usage intensity), which measures energy usage per square foot.

    "Above I have filtered out a list of years during which more than 100 properties were constructed. From that list I singled out the oldest 3 years and most recent 3 years, which make up the 6 lines in the density plot. We see that more recent years tend to have a higher density of properties with higher energy star scores. This is great! It indicates improved energy efficiency over time. I'm curious to see if this is at all related not only to year of construction, but property type. For example, the previous plots showed that office buildings tend to rank better in terms of energy scores. If most of the buildings put up recently are office buildings, then this may indicate that the higher scores from 2020-2022 are due to property types and not just improved construction/engineering practices.\n",

    "The correlation matrix above allows shows that many columns have a nearly-equivalent partner column. Moreover, there are two versions of many of the figures, one for `Source` and another for `Site`. For example, EUI is split into `Source EUI` and `Site EUI`. Based on this [document](https://www.nyc.gov/html/gbee/downloads/pdf/nyc_ll84_benchmarking_report_2012.pdf), source energy usage figures refer to the total energy needed to create the consumption levels on-site. Site energy usage does not take into account energy generation or losses and is thus a less comprehensive estimate of a property's total energy cost. In addition to site vs source energy usage, the correlation matrix shows us that energy usage columns are also partnered with a weather-normalized column, which exhibit nearly identical correlation coefficients.

In feature selection, we remove features that do not help our model learn the relationship between features and the target.

Rather than calculating multiple metrics and trying to determine how important each one is, we should use a single number. In this case, because we doing regression, the [__mean absolute error__](https://people.duke.edu/~rnau/compare.htm) is an appropriate metric. This is also interpretable because it represents the average amount our estimate if off by in the same units as the target value. \n",
